# 8085-Simulator
C++ program to emulate the functionality of 8085

There are many folders present in this.
Each folder has different purpose.

For eg - commands folder contains all the commands that are used in 8085.

Each folder has a seperate header file for funcitons definations and include.
So anyone can modified those files in future, instead of main definations and include file that is present in 8085-Simulator.

## how to run
run 8085_main.cpp
